# 🔐 Secure Your Device Anywhere

An Android application that helps locate and secure a **stolen or lost phone** by sending a **secret code via SMS** from another device.

---
## 📱 How It Works

1. User installs the app on their Android phone.
2. A **secret code** is set and stored securely inside the app.
3. If the phone is stolen/lost, user sends the code via **SMS** from any other phone.
4. Based on the received code, the app automatically triggers actions like:
   - 📍 **Send location**
   - 🔔 **Start ringing loudly**
   - 💡 **Blink flashlight continuously**
   - 📩 Or any combination
